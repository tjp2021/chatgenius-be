# ChatGenius Backend Progress

## Overall Goal
Build a scalable chat system with semantic search capabilities that can:
- Store and retrieve messages efficiently
- Find semantically similar messages across conversations
- Support real-time chat functionality
- Handle high message volumes through batching
- Provide context-aware responses

## Completed Work

### Vector Store Service (Core Foundation)
✅ Core functionality implemented:
- Message chunking and storage
- Semantic search with embeddings
- Batch processing support
- Comprehensive error handling

✅ Advanced Features:
- Time-based scoring
- Channel-based relevance
- Context preservation (reply chains)
- Duplicate handling
- Out-of-order chunk reconstruction

✅ Testing:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Edge case coverage
- Batch processing tests
- Error handling verification

### Infrastructure
✅ External Service Integration:
- Pinecone vector database
- Embedding service
- Text chunking service
