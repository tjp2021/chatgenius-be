## Auth Fix Post-Analysis (KISS Principle Win)

### Original Issue
- Frontend was sending token in multiple inconsistent ways
- Backend was trying to handle too many token formats
- Overcomplicated with Bearer prefixes and cookies

### The Fix
```typescript
// Backend (clerk-auth.guard.ts)
const token = request.headers.authorization;  // Simple, direct token access
await clerkClient.verifyToken(token);        // Direct verification
```

### Why It Works
- Single source of truth: Authorization header only
- No prefix manipulation
- No cookie parsing
- Direct token verification with Clerk

### Key Lessons
- KISS principle worked: Removed all the complex token handling
- Removed unnecessary cookie parsing
- Removed Bearer prefix handling
- Single, clear auth flow

### Best Practice Going Forward
- Keep using direct token passing in Authorization header
- Let Clerk handle the token verification
- Keep debug logs temporarily to catch issues
- Don't overcomplicate auth with multiple token sources
