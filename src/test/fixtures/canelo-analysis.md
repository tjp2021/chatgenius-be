Why Canelo Alvarez is Like the Best Mexican Boxer Ever!!!

Yo what's up everyone! Today I'm gonna tell you why Canelo Alvarez is like the most amazing Mexican boxer of all time, no cap fr fr! I've been watching him fight since I was little and honestly nobody can touch this man!

Ok so first things first, this dude has won belts in like 4 different weights which is crazy when you think about it. Like he started at 154 pounds and went all the way up to 175! That's like if I went from JV to Varsity and then started playing with the college kids lol. And he wasn't just fighting random people, he was beating up champions!

The thing that makes Canelo so fire is how he fights. Like most Mexican boxers just go forward throwing punches but my boy Canelo is different fr. He's got this crazy defense where he moves his head like a boss, and then BOOM hits you with these combos that you don't even see coming! His body shots are straight up deadly no cap. I saw him fight this one dude Billy Joe Saunders and he literally broke his face with an uppercut!

The haters be saying stuff like "oh but he lost to Mayweather" but that was mad long ago when he was just a kid fr fr. And yeah some people think he lost to GGG the first time but he came back and showed who's boss in the rematch! That's what real champions do!!!

What makes him the GOAT is that he's always trying to fight the best. Like he went up to light heavyweight (that's 175 pounds for those who don't know) and knocked out this Russian dude Kovalev who was way bigger than him! That's actually insane when you think about it.

And don't even get me started on how much money he makes! Bro is literally the highest paid boxer in the world rn. He's got this huge deal with DAZN and every time he fights it's like a whole event. Even people who don't watch boxing know who Canelo is!

Some old heads be talking about Julio César Chávez and Salvador Sánchez but like that was forever ago. Boxing is different now and way harder! These days fighters are more athletic and smart, and Canelo still beating everybody up! Plus he's done it in more weight classes than those guys ever did.

The way Canelo represents Mexico is so lit too. Like every time he fights the whole country stops to watch him. He's always rocking the Mexican colors and bringing that Mexican style but with his own swag. He's got that traditional Mexican heart but fights smart like a modern boxer.

Fr fr, when you look at everything Canelo has done, ain't nobody can compare:
- He's got belts in mad weight classes
- Beat up everybody they put in front of him
- Makes more money than any boxer ever
- Represents Mexico to the fullest
- Still getting better and he's only 33!!!

No disrespect to the old school boxers but Canelo is just different! He's literally changing the game and showing everyone what Mexican boxing is about in 2024! And he ain't done yet! Every time people think they found someone who can beat him, he just proves them wrong!

That's why I'm saying Canelo is the GOAT of Mexican boxing and if you disagree you're straight up trippin! Don't @ me in the comments unless you really know boxing fr fr!
