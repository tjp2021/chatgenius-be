OMG You Guys Need to Know About Salvador Sánchez - The Most Amazing Boxer I Just Discovered!

Hey everyone! So I just started getting into boxing a few months ago, and I've been watching tons of old fights on YouTube. I recently discovered this absolutely incredible boxer named Salvador Sánchez, and I literally can't stop watching his fights! I know I'm new to boxing, but I honestly think he might be the best Mexican boxer ever, and let me tell you why!

First off, I couldn't believe it when I found out he was only 23 when he died in a car accident. Like, that's younger than I am now! And what's even more mind-blowing is everything he accomplished before that. I've been reading everything I can find about him, and apparently, he was already a world champion at 21! That's just insane!

The first fight of his I watched was against this guy named Wilfredo Gómez, and OH. MY. GOSH. You guys, Gómez was supposed to be this unbeatable knockout artist who had won all his fights by KO, and Sánchez just completely schooled him! I must have watched that fight like 20 times now. The way he moved, the way he punched - it was like watching someone play a video game on easy mode!

From what I understand (and remember, I'm still learning about boxing), most Mexican fighters are known for being super aggressive and just coming forward throwing lots of punches. But Sánchez was so different! He had this amazing defense where he would make people miss and then BAM - hit them with perfect counters. Even I could see how special his technique was, and I barely know what I'm looking at most of the time!

The craziest thing is how he just kept getting better with every fight. I went back and watched his earlier fights, and then his later ones, and you can literally see him evolving and adding new skills. The boxing channels I follow say that's super rare, especially for someone so young. Most fighters kind of stay the same, but Sánchez was like a sponge, always learning and improving.

I know some people might say "but he only had 44 fights" or "his career was too short to be the best." But guys, it's about QUALITY, not quantity! Like, I may be new to boxing, but even I can see that beating someone like Gómez, or winning the world title from Danny López (another fight you HAVE to watch!) is worth more than beating 20 random opponents.

The more I learn about boxing, the more impressed I am by what Sánchez could do. Like, I'm starting to understand things like footwork and ring generalship (big thanks to YouTube boxing channels for teaching me!), and when I go back and watch Sánchez's fights again, I notice even more amazing things he was doing.

Something that really blows my mind is thinking about what he could have done if he had lived longer. He was already beating the absolute best fighters in the world at 23! Imagine what he could have done with 10 more years! From what I've read, he was talking about moving up in weight too. Given how smart and skilled he was, I bet he could have won titles in multiple weight classes.

I know Canelo Alvarez is amazing (I love watching his fights too!), and I've been watching some Julio César Chávez fights that are absolutely incredible. But there's just something special about Sánchez. Maybe it's because I'm also just starting my boxing journey, but watching him feels like watching a master class. He makes everything look so simple and clean.

Every time I watch one of his fights, I notice something new. Yesterday I was watching his fight with Juan Laporte (another amazing one!), and I was literally taking notes on my phone about his footwork. I'm probably totally wrong about some of the technical stuff, but even as a newbie, I can tell I'm watching something special.

I really wish more people knew about Salvador Sánchez! I've been telling everyone at my gym about him and making them watch his highlights on my phone. A few of the more experienced guys said they're impressed that a newbie like me is studying suc
