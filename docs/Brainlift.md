Problem Analysis [CG-20231218-001]

- **ID**: CG-20231218-001
- **Error Description**: 404 errors when attempting to leave a channel, with frontend making requests to `/channels/{id}/leave?shouldDelete=false`
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. HTTP method mismatch between frontend and backend
  2. Incorrect URL path construction
  3. Routing configuration issue
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Create or join a channel
  2. Click leave button on a channel
  3. Observe 404 errors in network tab
- **Logs/Info**: Network requests show POST attempts to `/channels/7bc24f5e-f1e9-43da-94b3-96ab9dbd1b74/leave?shouldDelete=false` returning 404

Solution Attempts [CG-20231218-001]:

1. First Attempt [CG-20231218-001-A]:
- Changed backend endpoint from @Delete to @Post
- Result: Still getting 404s
- Analysis: The controller already had @Post, so this wasn't the issue

2. Second Attempt [CG-20231218-001-B]:
- Verified route registration in module
- Result: Routes properly registered
- Analysis: Not a registration issue

3. Final Solution [CG-20231218-001-C]:
- Checked API documentation
- Found that API spec requires DELETE method
- Root cause: Frontend making POST requests when API requires DELETE
- Solution: Frontend needs to be updated to use DELETE method

Learning Lessons [CG-20231218-001]:
- **Pattern Recognition**: 
  1. API documentation and implementation mismatch
  2. Frontend making incorrect HTTP method calls
  3. Initial assumption about backend being wrong was incorrect

- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Always check API documentation first before making changes
  2. Verify both frontend and backend implementations match the documentation
  3. Don't assume the error is in the most recently changed code

- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Cross-reference API documentation with both frontend and backend code
  2. Follow RESTful conventions (DELETE for removal operations)
  3. Check all layers (docs, frontend, backend) before making changes

- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Implement API contract testing to catch method mismatches
  2. Keep API documentation as source of truth
  3. Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to automatically validate endpoints
