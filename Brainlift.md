Problem Analysis [CG-20240108-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-001
- **Error Description**: Browse modal showing empty arrays for both public and joined channels despite database showing correct channel membership. The frontend was correctly sending authorization tokens, but the backend was not properly extracting the user ID.
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Mismatch between where ClerkGuard stored user ID (`request.user.id`) and where UserId decorator looked for it (`request.auth.userId`)
  2. Potential caching issues with Redis (ruled out after investigation)
  3. Possible frontend state management issues (ruled out after logs showed backend returning empty data)
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Log in to the application
  2. Open the browse channels modal
  3. Observe empty lists despite being a member of channels
  4. Check network tab showing undefined userId in requests
- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
  ```log
  Getting public channels with options: {
    userId: undefined,
    search: undefined,
    sortBy: 'memberCount',
    sortOrder: 'desc'
  }
  ```

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20240108-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-001
- **Solution Description**: Updated the UserId decorator to extract the user ID from the correct location in the request object, matching where ClerkGuard stores it.
- **Why It Worked**: 
  1. ClerkGuard was correctly setting `request.user = { id: claims.sub }` after token verification
  2. The UserId decorator was looking in `request.auth.userId` which didn't exist
  3. Updating the decorator to use `request.user?.id` aligned it with the guard's implementation
  4. This allowed the user ID to flow correctly through the application stack
- **Key Lessons**: 
  1. The importance of consistent request object structure across the authentication stack
  2. Value of detailed logging that showed exactly where the user ID was undefined
  3. Understanding the full authentication flow from guard to decorator to service

Learning Lessons [CG-20240108-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-001
- **Pattern Recognition**: 
  1. Authentication-related bugs often stem from mismatches between different parts of the auth stack
  2. Empty results can indicate missing authentication data rather than data access issues
  3. The importance of following the entire request flow when debugging auth issues
- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Document the expected request object structure and where authentication data should be stored
  2. Add TypeScript interfaces for the extended Request type to catch these issues at compile time
  3. Implement consistent logging across the authentication flow
  4. Add integration tests that verify the entire auth stack works together
- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Keep authentication data storage consistent across the application
  2. Use TypeScript to enforce correct request object structure
  3. Implement comprehensive logging for authentication-related operations
  4. Follow the entire request flow when debugging, don't assume the issue is at the end
- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Create an AuthRequest interface that extends Request and defines expected auth properties
  2. Add middleware to validate request object structure after guard runs
  3. Implement auth flow monitoring to catch similar issues in production
  4. Add automated tests for the authentication decorator behavior

Problem Analysis [CG-20240108-002]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-002
- **Error Description**: Users attempting to leave/delete channels are receiving "Not a member of this channel" errors, despite the channel being visible in their channel list.
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Race condition between channel list fetch and leave/delete operation
  2. Stale frontend channel list not syncing with backend state
  3. Possible caching issue where frontend displays channels user has already left
  4. Membership check and channel list retrieval using different criteria
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. User views their channel list (showing channel ID: 4992be7d-5381-436d-9c86-17a499bc4994)
  2. User attempts to leave channel (both with shouldDelete: false and true)
  3. Backend reports user is not a member and throws error
- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
  ```log
  [Nest] 9943  - 01/08/2025, 11:38:49 AM   DEBUG [ChannelsService] Attempting to leave channel. UserId: user_2rJq9KAU2BssqEwo8S1IVtwvLKq, ChannelId: 4992be7d-5381-436d-9c86-17a499bc4994, ShouldDelete: false
  [Nest] 9943  - 01/08/2025, 11:38:50 AM   DEBUG [ChannelsService] User user_2rJq9KAU2BssqEwo8S1IVtwvLKq is not a member of channel 4992be7d-5381-436d-9c86-17a499bc4994 - already left
  [Nest] 9943  - 01/08/2025, 11:38:50 AM   ERROR [SocketGateway] Error: Not a member of this channel
  ```

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20240108-002]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-002
- **Solution Description**: Implement proper cache invalidation and synchronization between channel list and membership operations.
- **Why It Worked**: 
  1. Added cache invalidation for both channel list and membership status on leave/delete operations
  2. Implemented proper error handling to distinguish between "already left" and other membership errors
  3. Added WebSocket events to notify frontend of channel membership changes
  4. Synchronized channel list cache with membership status changes
- **Key Lessons**: 
  1. Cache invalidation needs to be comprehensive across all related data
  2. Real-time updates are crucial for maintaining UI/backend state consistency
  3. Error messages should be specific enough to handle edge cases

Learning Lessons [CG-20240108-002]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-002
- **Pattern Recognition**: 
  1. Cache invalidation is a common source of state inconsistency
  2. Real-time features require careful synchronization between frontend and backend
  3. Error handling needs to account for race conditions
- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Implement comprehensive cache invalidation strategies
  2. Use WebSocket events to maintain frontend/backend state consistency
  3. Add detailed logging for membership operations
  4. Implement retry mechanisms for race conditions
- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Always invalidate related caches together
  2. Use transactions for operations that affect multiple entities
  3. Implement proper error classification and handling
  4. Maintain detailed operation logs for debugging
- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Create a cache management service to handle related cache invalidations
  2. Implement optimistic UI updates with proper rollback
  3. Add monitoring for cache hit/miss rates
  4. Create automated tests for concurrent operations
