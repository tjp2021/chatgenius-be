Problem Analysis [CG-20240108-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-001
- **Error Description**: Browse modal showing empty arrays for both public and joined channels despite database showing correct channel membership. The frontend was correctly sending authorization tokens, but the backend was not properly extracting the user ID.
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Mismatch between where ClerkGuard stored user ID (`request.user.id`) and where UserId decorator looked for it (`request.auth.userId`)
  2. Potential caching issues with Redis (ruled out after investigation)
  3. Possible frontend state management issues (ruled out after logs showed backend returning empty data)
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Log in to the application
  2. Open the browse channels modal
  3. Observe empty lists despite being a member of channels
  4. Check network tab showing undefined userId in requests
- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
  ```log
  Getting public channels with options: {
    userId: undefined,
    search: undefined,
    sortBy: 'memberCount',
    sortOrder: 'desc'
  }
  ```

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20240108-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-001
- **Solution Description**: Updated the UserId decorator to extract the user ID from the correct location in the request object, matching where ClerkGuard stores it.
- **Why It Worked**: 
  1. ClerkGuard was correctly setting `request.user = { id: claims.sub }` after token verification
  2. The UserId decorator was looking in `request.auth.userId` which didn't exist
  3. Updating the decorator to use `request.user?.id` aligned it with the guard's implementation
  4. This allowed the user ID to flow correctly through the application stack
- **Key Lessons**: 
  1. The importance of consistent request object structure across the authentication stack
  2. Value of detailed logging that showed exactly where the user ID was undefined
  3. Understanding the full authentication flow from guard to decorator to service

Learning Lessons [CG-20240108-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-001
- **Pattern Recognition**: 
  1. Authentication-related bugs often stem from mismatches between different parts of the auth stack
  2. Empty results can indicate missing authentication data rather than data access issues
  3. The importance of following the entire request flow when debugging auth issues
- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Document the expected request object structure and where authentication data should be stored
  2. Add TypeScript interfaces for the extended Request type to catch these issues at compile time
  3. Implement consistent logging across the authentication flow
  4. Add integration tests that verify the entire auth stack works together
- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Keep authentication data storage consistent across the application
  2. Use TypeScript to enforce correct request object structure
  3. Implement comprehensive logging for authentication-related operations
  4. Follow the entire request flow when debugging, don't assume the issue is at the end
- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Create an AuthRequest interface that extends Request and defines expected auth properties
  2. Add middleware to validate request object structure after guard runs
  3. Implement auth flow monitoring to catch similar issues in production
  4. Add automated tests for the authentication decorator behavior

Problem Analysis [CG-20240108-002]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-002
- **Error Description**: Users attempting to leave/delete channels are receiving "Not a member of this channel" errors, despite the channel being visible in their channel list.
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Race condition between channel list fetch and leave/delete operation
  2. Stale frontend channel list not syncing with backend state
  3. Possible caching issue where frontend displays channels user has already left
  4. Membership check and channel list retrieval using different criteria
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. User views their channel list (showing channel ID: 4992be7d-5381-436d-9c86-17a499bc4994)
  2. User attempts to leave channel (both with shouldDelete: false and true)
  3. Backend reports user is not a member and throws error
- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
  ```log
  [Nest] 9943  - 01/08/2025, 11:38:49 AM   DEBUG [ChannelsService] Attempting to leave channel. UserId: user_2rJq9KAU2BssqEwo8S1IVtwvLKq, ChannelId: 4992be7d-5381-436d-9c86-17a499bc4994, ShouldDelete: false

Problem Analysis [CG-20240108-003]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-003
- **Error Description**: Multiple socket-related issues in channel joining flow:
  1. Initial "Unauthorized" socket errors
  2. "Already a member of this channel" errors
  3. Public channels sidebar not updating in real-time
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Socket authentication issues (token/userId validation)
  2. Double-join attempts (HTTP + Socket)
  3. Event emission mismatches between frontend/backend
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Click "Join Channel" in UI
  2. HTTP API successfully creates membership
  3. Socket attempts to join room
  4. Error occurs due to duplicate join attempt
- **Logs/Info**: Socket errors showing "Already a member" and "Unauthorized" messages

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20240108-003]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-003
- **Solution Description**: 
  1. Fixed socket authentication by properly validating token and userId
  2. Separated HTTP channel join from socket room join
  3. Changed socket handler to verify membership instead of attempting to join again
- **Why It Worked**:

- **Pattern Recognition**: 
  1. Socket authentication needs to be handled separately from HTTP auth
  2. Real-time features often have race conditions between HTTP and WebSocket operations
  3. Event-driven architectures need clear separation between state changes and notifications
- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Always separate data mutations (HTTP) from real-time updates (WebSocket)
  2. Implement proper authentication checks at both connection and message levels
  3. Use clear event naming and payload structures
- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Socket handlers should verify state, not modify it
  2. Authentication should be validated at connection time
  3. Clear error messages help identify issues quickly
- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Document WebSocket events and payloads clearly

Problem Analysis [CG-20240108-004]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-004
- **Error Description**: Real-time message handling implementation is incomplete with several missing critical components:
  1. No WebSocket events for message CRUD operations
  2. Missing typing indicators
  3. No message delivery confirmation system
  4. Lack of proper error handling for message events
  5. No handling of offline messages/reconnection
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Current WebSocket implementation focuses on connection/presence but not message events
  2. Message service and socket gateway are not properly integrated
  3. Missing event definitions and handlers for message operations
  4. No clear protocol for message delivery confirmation
  5. Lack of proper error propagation between services
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Current message creation only uses HTTP endpoint
  2. No real-time updates when messages are created/updated
  3. No indication of message delivery status
  4. No typing indicators when users are composing messages
  5. Messages may be lost during connection issues
- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
  ```typescript
  // Current message creation only uses HTTP
  @Post()
  create(@User() userId: string, @Body() dto: CreateMessageDto) {
    return this.messageService.create(userId, dto);
  }

  // Socket gateway missing message event handlers
  // No integration between MessageService and SocketGateway
  // No message delivery confirmation system
  ```

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20240108-004]
- **ID**: CG-20240108-004
- **Solution Description**: Integrate real-time message handling into existing socket.gateway.ts and message.service.ts:
  1. Add message event handlers in SocketGateway
  2. Extend MessageService to emit socket events
  3. Implement message delivery confirmation
  4. Add typing indicator handling
  5. Implement offline message queue using Redis
- **Why It Works**: 
  1. Builds on existing authentication and channel membership verification
  2. Maintains separation between HTTP (state changes) and WebSocket (real-time updates)
  3. Uses Redis for reliable message queuing and delivery tracking
  4. Leverages existing channel room structure for message broadcasting
- **Implementation Steps**:
  ```typescript
  // 1. Add message events to socket.gateway.ts
  @SubscribeMessage('message:send')
  async handleMessageSend(client: Socket, payload: CreateMessageDto) {
    try {
      const userId = client.handshake.auth.userId;
      const message = await this.messageService.create(userId, payload);
      
      // Broadcast to channel room
      this.server.to(`channel:${payload.channelId}`).emit('message:new', message);
      
      // Send delivery confirmation to sender
      client.emit('message:sent', { messageId: message.id });
      
      return message;
    } catch (error) {
      this.handleError(client, error);
    }
  }

  @SubscribeMessage('message:typing')
  async handleTypingIndicator(client: Socket, payload: { channelId: string, isTyping: boolean }) {
    const userId = client.handshake.auth.userId;
    this.server.to(`channel:${payload.channelId}`).emit('user:typing', { 
      userId, 
      channelId: payload.channelId,
      isTyping: payload.isTyping 
    });
  }

  // 2. Extend message.service.ts to handle offline messages
  async create(userId: string, dto: CreateMessageDto) {
    const message = await this.prisma.message.create({
      data: {
        content: dto.content,
        channelId: dto.channelId,
        userId,
        parentId: dto.parentId,
        deliveryStatus: 'pending'
      },
      include: {
        user: true,
      },
    });

    // Queue message for offline users
    const offlineMembers = await this.getOfflineChannelMembers(dto.channelId);
    if (offlineMembers.length > 0) {
      await this.cacheService.queueOfflineMessages(offlineMembers, message);
    }

    return message;
  }
  ```
- **Key Lessons**:
  1. Keep message sending logic in socket handlers for real-time delivery
  2. Use HTTP endpoints as fallback for poor connections
  3. Track message delivery status in database
  4. Queue messages for offline users

- **ID**: CG-20240108-004
- **Pattern Recognition**: 
  1. Existing codebase has solid foundation for authentication and channel management
  2. Current HTTP endpoints work well for basic message CRUD
  3. Socket gateway already handles room management and presence
  4. Clear separation between state management (HTTP) and real-time updates (WebSocket)
- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Create new handlers instead of modifying existing ones
  2. Keep message-specific logic in dedicated classes/methods
  3. Reuse existing authentication and room management
  4. Add new DTOs for message-specific events
- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Follow Single Responsibility Principle by separating message handling from channel management
  2. Stay DRY by reusing existing authentication and room management code
  3. Preserve working functionality by adding rather than modifying
  4. Use TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety in new code
- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Create MessageGateway class for message-specific socket handlers
  2. Add MessageEvents enum/const for event name management
  3. Implement MessageQueue service for offline message handling
  4. Create separate DTOs for each message event type

Problem Analysis [CG-20240110-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240110-001
- **Error Description**: WebSocket connections were failing with "No userId found in socket client" despite having valid auth tokens
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Initial: Thought it was a guard not running (incorrect)
  2. Then: Thought it was guard placement in decorators (incorrect)
  3. Finally: Operation order was wrong - validation was happening before authentication
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Connect to WebSocket with valid Clerk token
  2. Observe server logs showing "No userId found" despite successful connection
  3. Notice frontend shows successful connection while backend shows auth failure
- **Logs or Relevant Information**:
  ```
  Frontend:
  Initializing socket with token: eyJhbG...
  Socket connected successfully
  Socket ID: l8mw0UL2xMplkxgKAAAD

  Backend:
  ❌ No userId found in socket client
  ❌ Invalid client connection - no userId
  ```

Solution Walkthrough [CG-20240110-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240110-001
- **Solution Description**: Reordered the authentication flow to ensure proper sequencing
- **Solution Attempts**:
  1. First attempt: Tried moving `@UseGuards(WsGuard)` to individual methods
  2. Second attempt: Tried handling auth directly in connection handler
  3. Final solution: Fixed operation order in handleConnection and simplified validation flow
- **Why It Worked**: 
  - Previous implementations were checking for userId before it was set
  - Final solution ensures authentication (which sets userId) happens before validation
  - Removed redundant logging in helper methods to make the flow clearer
- **Key Code Changes**:
  ```typescript
  async handleConnection(client: AuthenticatedSocket) {
    // 1. First authenticate (this sets userId)
    const isAuthenticated = await this.authenticateClient(client);
    
    // 2. Then validate (this checks userId exists)
    if (!this.validateClient(client)) {
      // Handle failure
    }
  }
  ```

Learning Lessons [CG-20240110-001]
- **ID**: CG-20240110-001
- **Pattern Recognition**: 
  1. Operation order bugs are subtle - logs can show success and failure simultaneously
  2. Authentication flows often have multiple steps that must happen in sequence
  3. Helper methods should be pure and not handle side effects like logging
- **Prevention Strategies**:
  1. Always diagram authentication flows before implementing
  2. Keep authentication steps clearly ordered and documented
  3. Separate concerns: authentication, validation, and logging
  4. Use TypeScript to enforce state requirements
- **Best Practices Learned**:
  1. Authentication should always happen first in connection lifecycle
  2. Helper methods should be pure functions
  3. Log at decision points, not in utility functions
  4. Use clear, sequential naming for multi-step processes
- **Future Recommendations**:
  1. Create an Authentication Flow Checklist:
     - [ ] Token verification
     - [ ] User ID setting
     - [ ] State validation
     - [ ] Connection acceptance
  2. Add comments indicating order requirements:
     ```typescript
     // 1. MUST happen first: Authenticate and set userId
     await authenticateClient(client);
     
     // 2. MUST happen after auth: Validate state
     validateClient(client);
     ```
  3. Consider creating a WebSocket connection state machine
  4. Add integration tests that verify connection sequence

Problem Analysis [CG-20240110-001]

- **Issue Description**: Private channel creation is failing due to memberIds not being properly passed through the system
- **Symptoms**: 
  - memberIds appears twice in the data structure
  - Service receives memberIds as undefined
  - Validation error: "No members provided for private channel"
- **Impact**: 
  - Users cannot create private channels
  - Member management is broken
  - Poor user experience
- **Initial Investigation**: 
  - Logs show memberIds exists inside data object but not as separate parameter
  - Data structure shows: `{ data: { memberIds: [...] }, memberIds: undefined }`
- **Root Cause Hypotheses**: 
  1. Gateway is not properly extracting memberIds from payload
  2. Service is looking for memberIds in wrong location
  3. Data transformation between layers is inconsistent

Solution Attempts [CG-20240110-001]

- **Attempt 1**: Modified gateway to extract memberIds from payload
  - Result: Failed - memberIds still undefined in service
  - Learnings: The payload structure is more complex than initially thought

- **Attempt 2**: Added payload parsing and data cleaning in service
  - Result: Failed - memberIds still not being extracted correctly
  - Learnings: The issue is in how we're passing the data between layers

- **Attempt 3**: Implemented detailed logging and data extraction in service
  - Result: Identified that memberIds exists in data object but not being extracted
  - Learnings: Need to handle both locations where memberIds might exist

Final Solution [CG-20240110-001]

- **Solution Description**: Modified service to extract memberIds from both possible locations
- **Implementation Details**:
  ```typescript
  // Extract memberIds from data if it exists there
  const extractedMemberIds = (data as any).memberIds || memberIds || [];
  
  // Create clean data object without memberIds
  const { memberIds: _, ...cleanData } = data as any;
  ```
- **Verification**: Added comprehensive logging at each step to track data flow

  2. Initial implementation focused on basic functionality without full relational data

Solution Attempts [CG-20240111-001]
- **Attempt 1**: Modified findAll method
  - Result: Successful - Added nested include for user data in members
  - Learnings: Prisma's nested include pattern works well for this use case
  
- **Attempt 2**: Updated update and findById methods
  - Result: Successful - Standardized include pattern across all channel retrieval methods
  - Learnings: Consistency in data inclusion patterns improves API usability

Final Solution [CG-20240111-001]
- **Solution Description**: Implemented consistent user data inclusion across all channel-related operations
- **Implementation Details**: 
  - Added nested includes for user data in all relevant methods:
    ```typescript
    include: {
      members: {
        include: {
          user: true
        }
      },
      createdBy: true
    }
    ```
  - Methods updated:
    1. findAll() - Channel listing
    2. findById() - Single channel lookup
    3. update() - Channel updates
