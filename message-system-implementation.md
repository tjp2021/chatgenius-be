# Message System Implementation Status

## Problem Analysis [CG-20240109-001]
We're implementing a unified message system that needs to handle:
1. Basic message operations (create, read, delete)
2. Message features (reactions, read receipts, attachments)
3. Threading support (replies, thread views)
4. Real-time updates via WebSocket
5. Proper type safety and error handling

Current challenges:
- Type mismatches between Prisma client and our service layer
- Missing service dependencies (RedisCacheService, validateMessageAccess)
- Incomplete WebSocket event handling
- Need to properly handle message relations (reactions, read receipts)

## What's Been Accomplished
1. Database Schema
   - ✅ Message model with all required fields
   - ✅ Reaction, ReadReceipt, and Attachment models
   - ✅ Proper relations and indexes

2. DTOs and Types
   - ✅ CreateMessageDto
   - ✅ Message event enums
   - ✅ Socket event types

3. Services
   - ✅ Basic MessageService implementation
   - ✅ MessageGateway for WebSocket events
   - ✅ Initial ChannelsService message methods

## What Needs to Be Done
1. Fix Type Issues
   - [ ] Update MessageWithRelations type to match Prisma schema
   - [ ] Fix type casting in service methods
   - [ ] Add proper return types for all methods

2. Add Missing Dependencies
   - [ ] Inject RedisCacheService
   - [ ] Add validateMessageAccess method
   - [ ] Set up proper error handling

3. Complete Service Methods
   - [ ] Finish reaction handling
   - [ ] Implement read receipt logic
   - [ ] Add attachment support
   - [ ] Complete threading features

4. Testing and Validation
   - [ ] Add unit tests for all methods
   - [ ] Test WebSocket events
   - [ ] Validate error handling
   - [ ] Test edge cases

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Add missing service dependencies to ChannelsService constructor
2. Implement validateMessageAccess method
3. Fix type issues with Prisma client
4. Update message-related methods to use correct types
5. Add proper error handling

## Technical Decisions
1. Using MessageService for core message operations
2. Separating WebSocket events into MessageGateway
3. Using Redis for caching
4. Implementing proper validation at service level
